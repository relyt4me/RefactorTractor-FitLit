![FitLit Screenshot]()

* The FitLit site is a site for tracking all of your FitLit information! User can track their hydration amount, sleep amount, sleep quality, number of steps, number of stairs and active minutes per day or week. All of these measurements are compared to a user's friends and overall community averages.
* This Refactor Tractor FitLit project is the first major refactoring project given during the 2nd Module (10 weeks into the program) at Turing School of Software Engineering. We were given an already functioning FitLit website, with numerous issues, in which our goal was to refactor to allow for better accessibility, testing with chai-spies, DRY implementation, SRP implementaion while working with new team of Turing students. 
* This Project uses:
  * HTML
  * Javascripts
  * CSS/SASS
  * Chai/Mocha Testing
  * WebPack
